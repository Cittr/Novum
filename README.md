# theme.css (work in progress)
It is used in @import located in my Discord theme* .css file, which is an extended fork of once popular 'Nova' theme** made by github user din0s.

 *Adding themes to Discord is possible thanks to BetterDiscord - an extension to Discord made by github user rauenzi
 
**Last Nova release: 21 Apr 2017
