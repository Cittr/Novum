# Novum Discord Theme

### Big custom theme with couple of small addons.

To use theme, You need to download a Discord extension called [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) and then, after installation, put [Novum.theme.css](https://github.com/przemec/Novum/blob/master/Novum.theme.css) into "themes" folder (it can be found in BetterDiscord settings).
