# KGB Discord Theme (work in progress)

[theme.css](/theme.css) is used in @import located in my Discord theme* .css file, which is an extended fork of once popular ['Nova' theme](https://github.com/din0s/discord-theme/) made by [din0s](https://github.com/din0s/). Couple of features are taken from [ClearVision](https://github.com/Zerthox/ClearVision/) theme by [Zerthox](https://gitlab.com/Zerthox/)

*Adding themes to Discord is possible thanks to [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/) - an extension to Discord made by [rauenzi](https://github.com/rauenzi/)
